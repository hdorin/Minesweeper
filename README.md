# The Adventures of the Minesweeper

It's like minesweeper, but with additional features. It has the standard bomb squares, but it also has squares that reveal nearby bombs and squares that cover the surrounding explored squares.

You can use the cursor to play one the four difficulty levels thanks to the GraphicsLibray.

Fixed bug: it's impossible to click on a bomb in the beginning becuase the bombs are generated after that.
